#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n * n)


b)O(logn)


c)O(n)

## Exercise II

take n(height of the building in storys)( n / 2) half that and throw an egg off

    (1) if the egg breaks take everything below that story and half that and do the search again

    (2) if the egg survives i would take everything above that story and devide it by half and do  the search again

    repeat steps 1 or 2  until i have found the tallest floor that the egg will survive. 

the time complexity of this would be O(logn)
